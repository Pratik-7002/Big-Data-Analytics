# Analysis of Flight Delay Forecasts
Overview: In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of flight delays using advanced data processing techniques and deep learning models. Leveraging my expertise in Python, Hive, AWS Hadoop, and RapidMiner, I aimed to predict flight delays with high accuracy to enhance operational efficiency in the aviation industry.

Key Contributions:

Data Processing and Integration: Managed end-to-end data processing and organization of a vast airline dataset comprising over 1 million records. Utilizing Python, Hive, and AWS Hadoop, I ensured the dataset was cleansed, standardized, and ready for analysis. Collaborated with team members to integrate six years of historical flight data, refining the dataset for predictive analysis.

Model Development: Developed a sophisticated deep learning model using RapidMiner to predict flight delays. Through meticulous feature engineering and model optimization, the model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 93%. This involved training the model on various factors influencing flight delays, such as weather conditions, airport congestion, and historical performance data.

Technologies Used:

Python
Hive
AWS Hadoop
RapidMiner
Deep Learning Techniques

Outcomes and Impact: The predictive model generated valuable insights for airlines and aviation stakeholders, enabling proactive measures to mitigate flight delays and improve overall operational efficiency. By accurately forecasting potential delays, airlines can optimize flight schedules, allocate resources more effectively, and enhance the passenger experience.
